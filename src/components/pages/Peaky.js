            <p><b>Peaky Blinders is a British period crime drama television series created by Steven Knight. Set in Birmingham, England, the series follows the exploits of the Shelby crime family in the direct aftermath of the First World War. The fictional family is loosely based on a real urban youth gang of the same name, who were active in the city from the 1890s to the early 20th century.Peaky Blinders is an epic following of a gangster family of Irish Traveller or Romani origin set in Birmingham, England, in 1919, several months after the end of the First World War in November 1918. The story centres on the Peaky Blinders gang and their ambitious and highly cunning boss Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy). The gang comes to the attention of Major Chester Campbell (Sam Neill), a Detective Chief Inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) sent over by Winston Churchill from Belfast, where he had been sent to clean up the city of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Communists, gangs and common criminals.[4][5] Winston Churchill (played by Andy Nyman in series 1 and Richard McCabe in series 2) charged him with suppressing disorder and uprising in Birmingham and recovering a stolen cache of arms meant to be shipped to Libya.[6][7] The first series concludes on 3 December 1919 â€“ "Black Star Day", the event where the Peaky Blinders plan to take over Billy Kimber's betting pitches at the Worcester Races. </b></p>
